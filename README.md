Design and Modeling of a Novel Transformable Land/Air Robot 
The “Experimental data” shows the current trend of the four servos on different terrains.We use digital oscilloscopes to measure and record the current in real time.
The video shows the terrestrial locomotion, aerial locomotion and the transformable process.
